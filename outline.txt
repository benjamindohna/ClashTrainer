- Runs entirely in the terminal.

## 2. Elixir Equation Challenges
- Present small scenarios: opponent plays X cards, player plays Y cards.
- All cards are given; user must calculate the total elixir balance.
- Expands the quiz into more strategic exercises.

## 3. Web Version
- Move the quiz to a website.
- Display card images and interactive buttons.
- Clean, intuitive interface.

## 4. Advanced Learning Platform
- Add more complex exercises beyond elixir math.
- Include correct placement challenges using images.
- Users select the right tile/placement for given scenarios.

## 5. Purpose
- Provide a structured way for Clash Royale players to improve decision-making, elixir management, and placement skills.

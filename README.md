## Description
A simple training tool designed to help players of **Clash Royale** improve their strategic decision-making and mechanical skills. The project begins with a terminal-based elixir quiz and will grow into a full-featured web platform with interactive exercises.

## Purpose
The platform's goal is to provide a structured way for players to improve:
* **Elixir Awareness:** Instinctive knowledge of card costs and managing the elixir bar.
* **Card Recognition:** Quick identification of cards and their strategic roles.
* **Elixir Trade Evaluation:** Accurately calculating the value of card exchanges.
* **Placement Accuracy:** Mastering optimal card placement on the arena map (future phase).

## Project Outline & Features

This project is planned across several developmental phases:

### 1. Initial Prototype (Terminal Quiz)
* **Goal:** Simple quiz for Clash Royale cards running entirely in the terminal.
* **Mechanism:** User is shown a card name and inputs the correct elixir cost (e.g., Knight → 3).
* **Current Status:** **Implemented.** Uses a JSON card database.

### 2. Elixir Equation Challenges
* **Goal:** Expand the quiz into more strategic, math-based exercises.
* **Mechanism:** Present small scenarios (opponent plays X cards, player plays Y cards) and the user calculates the total elixir balance.

### 3. Web Version
* **Goal:** Move the training platform to a clean, intuitive website.
* **Mechanism:** Display card images and use interactive buttons for input, improving the user experience.

### 4. Advanced Learning Platform
* **Goal:** Add more complex challenges beyond simple elixir math.
* **Mechanism:** Include correct placement challenges using arena images, requiring users to select the optimal tile/placement for given scenarios.
